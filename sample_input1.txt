I can't believe I got the job! This is the best day of my life.
Even though I tried my best, I still failed. I feel so disappointed and sad.
My friends threw me a surprise party, and I was completely shocked!
I love spending time with my family, they make me feel so warm inside.
The thunderstorm last night was terrifying. I couldn't sleep at all.
Why did you break my favorite mug? I'm really angry about this.
I feel nothing. Everything seems dull and empty.
She smiled at me, and my heart skipped a beat.
I studied all night, but the exam was still so hard. I'm frustrated.
When I heard the news, I was both happy and scared at the same time.
